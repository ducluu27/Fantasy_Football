# Fantasy_Football

## Overview
Creating a linear regression machine learning model to predict the 2021 Fantasy Football Draft. The data was provided by Pro Football Reference 

## Machine Learning Model
This is my first attempt creating a machine learning model that can predict the 2021 Fantasy Football draft. It is still a work in progress.

## Player Comparison 
The FF_Player contains the player comparison dataframe. I wanted to use the skills I acquire in the boot camp to help me display data better for Fantasy Football drafts. It is very simple to use and read:

   1. Run each line until you get to the input(). I recommend copying and pasting a players name from one of the Stat files from the Resources folder. The reason behind this is because some of the names have an extra space after the last name. It is easier to just cnrtl+f the excel file and copy and paste the names into the boxes.

   2. Run the rest of the lines and the final player_merge will display the players from both inputs sorted by year.

   3. If you want to change any of the players out just go back to the input line press the enter key and repeat steps 1 and 2.
